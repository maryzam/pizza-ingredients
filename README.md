# üçï It's a pizza party

Hello! 
My name is Mary and I love pizza.
And it's time to turn all my love to an awesome dataviz about pizza!

## Let's make the best pizza!

There are a lot of type of pizza. 
Pepperoni of Four Cheeses? Veggie or Hawaiian?
What is your favourite pizza? And which one is the best choice for your fiends or your collegues?
I desided to make a rating of pizza ingridients and explore if there is an actual variety of tasts or pizza is only about cheesa and tomato souce? 

## Where does the data come from?

I'm going to use several basing sources:
- make a list of pizzas (and their ingridients) using menus for top pizza chains of the US.
- make a list of most popular pizza recepies using top cooking sites.
